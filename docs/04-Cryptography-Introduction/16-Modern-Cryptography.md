## Modern Advances in Cryptography

With the advancements of Computing, Networking, Storage and Internet Cryptography as a field has really taken off.    

Modern Cryptography is a complex system involving Mathematical Algorithms, Advanced Computing, Hardware Accelerated Devices, Networking Systems and Private and Public Crypto Infrastructures.

Encryption in modern times is achieved by using algorithms that have a key to encrypt and decrypt information. These keys convert the messages and data into Cyphertext through encryption and then return them to the original form through decryption.

Robustness of a Cryptosystem lies in its Key, Infrastructure, Protocols and Rules of the Cryptosystem.

> **Claude E. Shannon** is considered to be the father of **mathematical cryptography**.


## Traditional vs Modern Cryptography

| Traditional Cryptography | Modern Cryptography |
|:--:|:--:|
| Based on manipulation of letters, digits and Symbols etc | Based on manipulation of binary data or bit sequences |
| Based on `Security through Obscurity` | Implement publicly known mathematical algorithms.
| Complete Crypto System is kept Secret | Algorithm are mostly well known whereas Decryption Keys are secret |
| Comparatively Not Computation Intensive | Computational Intensive |
| Easy to Attack/Crack | Difficult to Attack/Crack |
| These are weaker as compared to modern encryption| Stronger as compared to traditional encryption algorithms |

## What is Cryptology?

Cryptology is the mathematics, such as number theory, and the application of formulas and algorithms, that underpin cryptography and cryptanalysis.

Cryptology can be subdivided into:

- Cryptography
- Cryptanalysis

### Cryptography

**Cryptography is the art and science of making a cryptosystem that is capable of providing information security.**

Cryptography deals with the actual securing of digital data. It refers to the design of mechanisms based on mathematical algorithms that provide fundamental information security services. You can think of cryptography as the establishment of a large toolkit containing different techniques in security applications.

### Cryptanalysis

**The art and science of breaking the CipherText is known as cryptanalysis.**

Cryptanalysis is the parallel branch of cryptography and they both co-exist. Cryptanalysis is also used during the design of the new cryptographic techniques to test their security strengths.

> Cryptography concerns with the design of cryptosystems, while cryptanalysis studies the breaking of cryptosystems.
