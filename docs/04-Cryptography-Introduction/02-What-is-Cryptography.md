Cryptography is the **science of secret writing**. Its a practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called **adversaries**.

It is a **technique of securing information and communications through use of codes** so that only those person for whom the information is intended can understand and process it, thus preventing unauthorized access to information.

The prefix **“crypt” means “hidden”** and suffix **graphy means “writing”**.

Modern cryptography is based on concepts from **multiple disciplines** such as mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. 

In Cryptography the techniques to protect information are obtained from **mathematical concepts** and **algorithms** that convert messages in ways that make it hard to decode it.

## Use of cryptography and algorithms 

Cryptographic algorithms are used for: 

- Cryptographic key generation
- Digital signing
- Message Encryption
- Message Decryption
- Verification of encrypted/hashed messages, 
- Verification of keys
- Sharing and Management of Keys

## Applications of cryptography 

- Enable secured Web browsing on internet
- Protect confidential transactions such as credit card and debit card transactions
- Securing Networks over Internet - IPsec, HTTPS
- Securing Networks inside Data Centres - IPSec
- Securing IOT Networks - Secured MQTT
- User Authentication and Authorization - Web Authentication
- Military Applications 
- Space Applications
- E-Commerce
- Chip based E-Payments
- Digital Currencies - Bitcoin
- Mobile phones connecting to cell towers.
- Credit cards, EC-cards, access codes for banks.
- Electronic passports; soon ID cards
- Internet commerce, online tax declarations, webmail
- Facebook, Gmail, WhatsApp, iMessage on iPhone.
- Any webpage with https
- PGP encrypted email, Signal, Tor, Tails, Qubes OS

## Misuse of cryptography

- Illegal communication on Messaging Platforms

Most messaging Platforms now a days use cryptography for secured communication, which are misused by miscreants for Illegal communication. Its hard for governments to intercept those messages.

- Piracy Issues on Peer to Peer Networks 

It has become difficult to check Content Piracy due to Peer to Peer Networks using cryptography.

- Data Stealing and Privacy

Many apps on computing devices like Smartphones use cryptography to hide stealing of uses data leading to Privacy concerns.

- Spying Devices and Bots

Many Spying Devices and Bots use cryptography to for spying leading to Privacy concerns.
