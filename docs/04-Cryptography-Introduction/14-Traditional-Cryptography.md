## Traditional Cryptographic Systems

In the earlier sections, we have discussed briefly about Classical Ciphers (Substitution ciphers and Transposition ciphers) which are same as Traditional Cryptographic Systems.

> Cryptographic systems are also referred to as Ciphers

In this section we will discuss the Traditional Cryptographic Systems or ciphers in further details.

## Classic Ciphers - Recap

Classical cipher are types of ciphers that were used historically, but have been replaced by modern cryptographic algorithms.

Most classical ciphers have been practically computed, solved and are also very simple to break with modern technology.

### Types of classical ciphers

- Substitution ciphers
  - Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers
  - Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher
- Transposition ciphers

## Facts about traditional cryptosystems

- Most of these systems are based on symmetric key encryption scheme.
- The only security service these systems provide is confidentiality of information.
- Unlike modern systems which are digital and treat data as binary numbers, the earlier systems worked on alphabets as basic element.
