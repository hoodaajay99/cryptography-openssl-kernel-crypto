## Modern Advances in Cryptography

With the advancements of Computing, Networking, Storage and Internet Cryptography as a field has really taken off.    

Modern Cryptography is a complex system involving Mathematical Algorithms, Advanced Computing, Hardware Accelerated Devices, Networking Systems and Private and Public Crypto Infrastructures.

Encryption in modern times is achieved by using algorithms that have a key to encrypt and decrypt information. These keys convert the messages and data into Cyphertext through encryption and then return them to the original form through decryption.

Robustness of a Cryptosystem lies in its Key, Infrastructure, Protocols and Rules of the Cryptosystem.

**Claude E. Shannon** is considered to be the father of **mathematical cryptography**.

Following are some advanced topics of Modern Cryptography:
