## What is a Cipher?

In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption. It is series of well-defined steps that can be followed to achieve encryption or decryption operation.

## Types of Ciphers

Ciphers can be categorized in many ways:

- By whether they use Classical approach such as Substitution or are based on Modern Mathematical Algorithms 
- By whether they work on blocks of symbols usually of a fixed size (block ciphers), or on a continuous stream of symbols (stream ciphers).
- By whether the same key is used for both encryption and decryption (symmetric key algorithms), or if a different key is used for each (asymmetric key algorithms).

Following is a diagram which tries to categorize Ciphers based on many approach:

### Classical Ciphers

Classical cipher are types of ciphers that were used historically, but have been replaced by modern cryptographic algorithms. 

Most classical ciphers have been practically computed, solved and are also very simple to break with modern technology.

### Types of classical ciphers

Majorly categorized into two types:

#### Substitution ciphers

In a substitution cipher, letters (or groups of letters) are systematically replaced throughout the message for other letters (or groups of letters).

A well-known example of a substitution cipher is the **Caesar cipher**.

Substitution ciphers can be further divided into Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers and Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher.

- **Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers:**
 
  - Just one cipher alphabet is used, eg. "a, c, d, x, p".
  - Example: **Caesar cipher**

- **Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher:**

  - Multiple cipher alphabets are used, eg a matrix of alphabets
  - Examples: **Vigen√®re cipher**

#### Transposition ciphers

In a transposition cipher, the letters themselves are kept unchanged, but their order within the message is scrambled according to some well-defined scheme.
