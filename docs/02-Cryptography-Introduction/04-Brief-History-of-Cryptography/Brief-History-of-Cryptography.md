Ability to communicate **selectively** and **secretely** with the other party has been the inherent need of Human Beings in all civilization from ancient to Modern.

## Cryptographic in Ancient Times

Cryptography, the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets, began thousands of years ago.

### Hieroglyph - The Oldest Cryptographic Technique

`hieroglyph` was the very first known cryptography used by Egyptians some 4000 years ago. Below is a picture of hieroglyph

### Mono-alphabetic substitution

Around 500 to 600 BC, **mono-alphabetic substitution ciphers** were used which involved replacing alphabets of message with other alphabets with some secret rule.

This secret rule "thus called `Key`" was known to the sender and recepient only.

### Caesar Shift Cipher

Around 8th Century BC, Roman Empire used a method of cryptography called **Caesar Shift Cipher**. Caesar Shift Cipher relies on shifting the letters of a message by an agreed number.

The recipient of this message would then shift the letters back by the same number and obtain the original message.

Many variations of Caesar cipher were later developed.

### Mlecchita vikalpa in Kama Sutra

Aroung 400 BC Indians used Cypher called Mlecchita vikalpa in **Kama Sutra**


## Cryptography in Medival History

**Frequency analysis** technique for breaking monoalphabetic substitution ciphers were developed by **Al-Kindi**, an Arab mathematician and monoalphabetic substitution cyphers became vulnerable.

### Polyalphabetic Ciphers (Vigenère cipher)

The further breakthrough after monoalphabetic cypher was polyalphabetic. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using **multiple substitution alphabets**. 

The Vigenère cipher is the best-known example of a polyalphabetic cipher.

### Steganography

Another Cryptography technique developed was **Steganography**. It added another dimension to Cryptography. 

In Steganography, infomation was encrypted in such a way that any unauthorized person would not even know that any infomation was encrypted in the first place or not.

By Definition, Steganography is a method of hiding secret data, by embedding it into an audio, video, image or text file. It is one of the methods employed to protect secret or sensitive data from malicious attacks.

### Example of Steganography: Invisible Watermarking.

## Evolution of Cryptography from 1800 to World War II

In 19th century, cryptography evolved from the simple approaches to encryption to the more sophisticated art and science of information and security. Many more advanced encryption or cryptanalysis (the science of finding weaknesses in crypto systems) systems were develped.

By World War II, **mechanical and electromechanical** cipher machines were in wide use such as the **Enigma rotor machine**. Places where such machines were impractical, code books and manual systems were in use. 

Mechanical and electromechanical provided more advanced and efficient means of coding the information.

Great advances were made in both cipher design and cryptanalysis.
