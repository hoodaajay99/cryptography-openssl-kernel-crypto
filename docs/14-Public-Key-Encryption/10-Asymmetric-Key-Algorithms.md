## Examples of asymmetric key encryption

Public key cryptography algorithms today are used for key exchange or digital signatures.

- RSA
- Diffie-Hellman - Used for secret-key key exchange only
- Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) - provides Digital signature for message - authentication
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
- Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)
- Key Exchange Algorithm (KEA)
