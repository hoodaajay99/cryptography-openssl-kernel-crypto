## Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields.

ECC requires smaller keys compared to non-EC cryptography to provide equivalent security.


## Cryptographic schemes

- Elliptic Curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme
- Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES)
- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)


## Applications

Elliptic curves are applicable - 
- key agreement, 
- digital signatures, 
- pseudo-random generators
- Encryption by combining the key with a symmetric encryption scheme.
