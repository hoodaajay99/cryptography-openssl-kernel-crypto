## Key Escrow

**Key escrow** is an arrangement in which the keys needed to decrypt encrypted data are held in **escrow** so that, under certain circumstances, an authorized third party may gain access to those keys. 

These third parties may include businesses, who may want access to employees' secure business-related communications, or governments, who may wish to be able to view the contents of encrypted communications for law enforcement.
