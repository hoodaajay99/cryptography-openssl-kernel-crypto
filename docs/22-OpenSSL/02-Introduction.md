## What is OpenSSL

Definition from Wikipedia:

> OpenSSL is a **software library** for applications that **secure communications over computer networks** against eavesdropping or need to identify the party at the other end. It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites.

## Objective of OpenSSL

Develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. 

## OpenSSL Provides
- CLI tool for cryptography tasks, such as creating and handling certificates and related files.
- Cryptographic library called **libcrypto**.
- A library for enabling SSL/TLS communications **libssl** to provide SSL and TLS Protocols support within clients or servers applications.

## Features of OpenSSL

- Open-source implementation of the SSL/TLS and PKI protocols
- Core Library written in the C programming language
- Implements basic cryptographic functions and provides various utility functions
- Available for most Unix-like operating systems (including Linux, macOS, and BSD) and Microsoft Windows.
- Governed by OpenSSL Software Services (OSS)

> Language Specific Wrappers allow the use of the OpenSSL library in a variety of computer languages.
